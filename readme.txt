warHUD is a custom HUD modification for TF2, based on the legacy of RevanXP's HUD.
Its main design goal show things as bluntly yet mellow as possible.

Install:

Rename your resource and scripts folders before installing.
Copy the contents of tf/ into your own tf/ directory.
If you have an HUD crosshair already you should know what to do to move it over to this HUD.

I missed RevanXP's HUD and get so frustrated when I play without it that I decided to make my own version of it from scratch.
I don't have anything but the most important ingame elements done right now so don't expect custom class or team select menus (yet; they're the next thing I want to do).
Should be compatible with everything 5:4 and wider. Haven't tested MvM thoroughly on 5:4.
